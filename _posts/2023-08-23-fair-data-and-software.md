The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines for optimising the reuse of research data
and software. Adopting them in our research can improve the visibility, efficiency, and
impact of our work, in addition to aiding reproducibility and promoting open science
practices.

In this talk, Liam Pattinson discusses the FAIR principles in detail and explains how to
implement them in practice. The talk also covers the ways in which data and software
should be treated differently.

The slides are available [here][slides].
