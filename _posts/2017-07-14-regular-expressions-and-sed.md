title: Searching for Answers in a Text-Based Universe
subtitle: A Brief Introduction to Regular Expressions
---

Regular expressions are a powerful way to express patterns in text,
and are incredibly useful for hunting through large blocks of text for
the proverbial needle, or replacing multiple instances of one pattern
with another. This week, Jacob Wilkins led a hands-on session
introducing regular expressions (or regex) and how to use them
effectively.

You can get the slides for the talk [here][slides] and the example files used
during the sessions [here][repo].
