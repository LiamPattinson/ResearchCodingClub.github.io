Have you ever wondered if the programs you write are making the best use of your computing resources? Could your hour-long calculations be run in only a few minutes?

In this Research Coding Club talk, Ed Higgins discusses how to use profiling tools to identify regions of your code which take significant amounts of time, and offers some suggestions and examples for how these might be optimised and distributed across multiple CPU cores.

These techniques can be used in a wide range of languages and there are examples of how this can be done in scripting languages such as Python and R, as well as compiled languages such as C, C++ and Fortran.
