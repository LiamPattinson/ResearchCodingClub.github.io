title: Debugging

Bugs in code are a fact of life, and being able to quickly debug a
failing program is a vital skill for any software developer. This
week, Matt Probert led another hands-on session on debugging using the
standard Linux debugger, gdb.

You can find the slides for this session [here][1] and [here][2].
