This week [Emma Rand][emma] gave a talk and live demo on making packages in R. 
The talk covers motivation for why you might want to make a package in the first place and the live demo went through all the steps of creating a basic package and getting it up and running.

The slides can be found in Emma's [GitHub repository][slides] and you can view a recording of the talk [here][recording].
