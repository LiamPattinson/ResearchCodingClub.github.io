Today's Coding Club was presented by Killian Murphy, who talked us through software project management, from capturing the needs of the project, through the design process, to implementing and, ultimately, maintaining the software. Along the way he covered many useful tools to help ease you through the process, including [Treesheets][treesheets], [Snakemake][snakemake] and [Vagrant][vagrant].

You can find the original slides for this talk [here][slides].
