Do you run MATLAB code on your own computer? Would you like it to run faster and not hog your computer? Would you like to use MATLAB on the university's Viking computing cluster without having to know how to use Linux? Then this session is for you.

In this Research Coding Club talk, Phil Harrison introduced some easy ways to speed up MATLAB code and how to use MATLAB on your own computer to send jobs to Viking.
