Have you ever wanted to use a Python GUI with your C functions? What about combining Python's string handling with bespoke Fortran code? If so, then this Coding Club was for you! Ben Dudson and Jacob Wilkins gave us a hands-on practical session which took us through all the steps needed to combine Python and C/Fortran. As well as the examples and practical exercises, they talked us through the philosophy and approaches of the languages, f2py + James Kermode's [f90wrap][f90wrap] and Cython, and showed us how to get the best of all worlds. 

You can find the repository for the examples [here][examples], the slides for Python+f2py [here][f2py] and the Cython slides  [here][Cython].
