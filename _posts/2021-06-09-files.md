- What's the difference between YAML and JSON, and why should you care?
- Why do ten thousand 1-byte files take up more disk space than one 10,000-byte file?
- What is this ðŸ’¾ and why does it mean save?

This week Peter answered all the above and more, when he talked about
everything to do with files: how they're stored on disk, how your
computer interacts with the hardware, and the pros and cons of various
file formats for input, data, and text.

# Magnetic recording

- Most common way to store data is via magnetisation:
    - floppy disks
    - hard disks
    - audio or data tapes
- All basically work the same way
- Store information in direction of magnetisation
    - Could be analog like in audio tape
    - or digital like in hard disks
- Hard disk drives (HDDs) great compromise of speed, density, and cost
- Data tapes very slow, but amazingly dense and cheap
    - Great for long-term storage and backups

# Solid state drives (SSDs)

- SSDs use "floating gate" transistors to store charge
- Insulated "cell" that holds charge and modifies threshold voltage of
  transistor
- Insulation breaks down after too many writes
- Good density with no moving parts
- Comparatively expensive vs magnetic media
- Much, much faster

# Dealing with failure


!["ShipServ data centre", yurri, CC BY-NC 2.0](/img/files_210609/data_centre.jpg)


- ~millions of hours between failures...
- ...but 100,000 disks in one data centre means tens of disks need
  replacing each day
- RAID: Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
- Writing data to more than one disk at the same time
- Can improve resilience to disk failure
- Can improve IO (input/output) performance
- RAID is not the same thing as backups!


# RAID 0 and 1: stripping and mirroring


![RAID 0, Cburnett, CC BY-SA 3.0](/img/files_210609/RAID_0.png)


![RAID 1, Cburnett, CC BY-SA 3.0](/img/files_210609/RAID_1.png)


# RAID 1+0 (10): stripping + mirroring

![RAID 10, Cburnett, CC BY-SA 3.0](/img/files_210609/RAID_10.png)

# Disk drives

- All\* disk drives are based on **sectors**
- Sector is contiguous chunk of data on drive read or written all at once
<!-- - Sectors are grouped into **volumes** -->
- OS uses **blocks** (typically 512 bytes)
- Big HDDs may have sectors of 4096 bytes
- Lots of small files can use up more physical disk space than their
  logical size

# Filesystem drivers


- Already skipped over some layers!
    - like the firmware *inside* the disk
- Filesystems control how operating system interacts with files
- Lots of different types of filesystems, some specialised for
  different hardware (e.g. optical discs)
- Also virtual filesystems: in UNIX, everything is a file!
  e.g. `/dev/null`, `/proc/meminfo`

Some common filesystems:
- ext4, XFS, btrfs, FAT, exFAT, NTFS, HFS+, Lustre, GPFS

# What does a filesystem do?

- Manage space:
  - writing blocks/sectors
  - handles fragmentation of disk space
  - disk quotas
- Filenames:
    - case sensitivity: are `MYFILE`, `myfile`, `MyFiLe` the same?
    - allowed characters
    - allowed names (YouTube: Tom Scott, "Why You Can't Name A File CON In Windows")
- Directories or folders
- Metadata:
    - timestamps
    - file size (logical/physical)
    - file location
    - disk metadata
- Permissions

# Fancier features

- Journaling:
    - Keep track of changes to be made
    - If there's a crash before completion, can replay changes from
      last good state
- Encryption:
    - Encrypt the whole disk, rather than individual files
- Copy-on-write:
    - Make zero-sized backups
- Distributed:
    - Beyond RAID, how to have a petabyte filesystem
- Hierarchical storage:
    - Burst buffers

# Filesystem data structures

- How does filesystem know where on disk to find `MyFile.txt`?
- Information about files and directories stored in data structures
  directly on disk
- Directory data structures contain mapping of filename to "inode"
  number
- Inode table has all the metadata about file -- except the filename
- Metadata includes location of file blocks on disk

# Filesystem data structures

![inode schematic](/img/files_210609/inode_schematic.png)

# Filesystem data structures

- Some filesystems have limit on number of inodes => limit on number
  of files/directories
- Some filesystems have performance issues with large number of files
  in a directory
- Can have multiple filenames mapped to same inode!
- All this takes up space on disk

# Virtual files

- OS manages all hardware connected to computer through virtual files
    - block devices: hardware that reads and writes in discrete blocks
    - character devices: read and write a character at a time
    - pseudo-files: "files" created by OS
    - regular file: a regular file

- Pseudo-files:
- Can be used for information
    - `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/sys/kernel/version`
- or control aspects of OS
    - `/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops`, `/proc/sys/fs/file-max`
- Special types of input
    - `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/full`
- or special types of output
    - `/dev/null`

# File formats

- Files are collections of bytes
- Need a program to give them meaning
- Same way computer programs are collections of bytes, and need a CPU
  to give them meaning
- File format is a standard for specifying the meaning
- Could be collective standard, e.g. JPEG, MP3, LaTeX
- or proprietary, e.g. `.docx`, Photoshop
- or even just internal to a particular program

# How does OS know what type a file is?

- Windows just goes by extension
- Others go by magic numbers

```
$ hexdump -Cn8 filesystem_os.png
00000000  89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a  |.PNG....|
```

- `file` utility can tell you what type a file is

```
$ file filesystem_os.png
filesystem_os.png: PNG image data, 519 x 768, 8-bit/color RGBA,
non-interlaced
```
- We can open a file with the "wrong" program
    - Will probably get nonsense!

# Text files

## Plain text

```
- Just the raw text, no formatting
- Pros: good for simple, unstructured text
- Cons: terrible for just about everything else
```

# Text files

## LaTeX

```latex
\begin{block}{LaTeX}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Plain text'', but with \emph{formatting} and semantic markup
\item Requires compiling into rendered document
\item Pros:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Great for maths-heavy text
  \item Great for journals
  \end{itemize}
\item Cons:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Requires editing-compiling loop to see output
  \item Difficult to collaborate with non-users
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
```

# Text files


## Word/Open Document Format

- Zipped directory of XML files
- What You See Is What You Get
- Formatting and semantic info
- Pros:
    - Easy to use and share
- Cons:
    - Not simple text file means difficult to integrate into software
      packages
    - Easy for semantic info to get out of sync with formatting


```xml
<w:p><w:pPr><w:pStyle w:val="Heading2"/></w:pPr>
  <w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">
    Word/Open Document Format
  </w:t></w:r>
</w:p>
<w:p><w:pPr><w:numPr><w:ilvl w:val="0"/><w:numId w:val="1038"/>
  </w:numPr><w:pStyle w:val="Compact"/></w:pPr>
  <w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">
    Zipped directory of XML files
  </w:t></w:r>
</w:p>
```


# Text files

## Markdown/ReStructuredText

```markdown
## Markdown/ReStructuredText

- "Plain text", but with *formatting* and *semantic* markup
- Requires compiling into rendered document, but still human-readable
- [Github Flavour](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Pros:
    - Great for READMEs and technical documents
    - Most Git web services can render both formats directly
    - ReadTheDocs can automate building as both HTML and PDF
- Cons:
    - Reliant on compiling program for rendering
    - No one standard for Markdown, hodge-podge of extensions
    - ReStructuredText is more complex
```

# Configuration files

## JSON

- JavaScript Object Notation
- As used in: practically everything
- Pros: Great for data transfer
- Cons: No comments

```json
[
  {
    "Ziggy": { "age": 6, "colour": "Tabby" }
  },
  {
    "Lana": { "age": 6, "colour": "Black" }
  }
]
```

# Configuration files

## YAML

- Yet Another Markup Language
- As used in: Github Actions
- Pros: Less quoting required than JSON
- Cons: More features means more complex

```yaml
# Here are some cats
- Ziggy:
  - age: 6
    colour: Tabby
- Lana:
  - age: 6
    colour: Black
```

# Configuration files

## TOML

- Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language
- As used in: pyproject.toml
- Pros: Simpler syntax than YAML
- Cons: More opinionated than JSON

```toml
# Here are some cats
[Ziggy]
age = 6
colour = "Tabby"

[Lana]
age = 6
colour = "Black"
```

# Output files

## Raw binary

- Just dumping the internal state to disk!
    - For example, Fortran unformatted files or Python binary files
- Good for intermediate/checkpoint state
- Pros:
    - Can be very fast to implement and use
    - Guaranteed exact round-tripping (on same machine, version)
- Cons:
    - Risk of not being portable across machines/versions
    - Very low discoverability/not self-documenting
    - Can be difficult to manage complex or growing datasets

# Output files

## Comma/tab-separated values

- Writing everything out in text
- Good for small to medium sized datasets
- Pros:
    - Near universal, everything from Excel to Haskell can read/write
    - Can be self-documenting to some extent
- Cons:
    - Slow/expensive for lots of data
    - Less good for multi-dimensional or complex data

# Output files

## HDF5/netCDF

- Hierarchical Data Format
- Structured data files with lots of features
- Good for large or complex datasets
- Pros:
    - High discoverability/self-documentation
    - Great for datasets with growing elements
    - Can attach attributes and coordinates to values
    - Compression means writing can be faster
    - Parallel IO API for HPC filesystems
- Cons:
    - Low-level API is complex
    - Needs special library to read files
    - Strings weirdly complex?

# Conclusion


- Disk drives read/write in discrete blocks
    - Implications for writing small files
- Filesystems store file information in inodes
    - Implications for numbers of files
    - Implications for large files
- Choose your file formats carefully
