This week was the end of term, so we did something a little bit
different. Jacob gave us a whistlestop tour of code games, including
code golf, Project Euler and esolangs, before leading us in a art
competition using javascript!

You can find the original slides for this talk [here][slides], and the
javascript and html files needed for the code game here:
