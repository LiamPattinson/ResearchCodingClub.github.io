title: Data Analysis in Python with Pandas

What do you do with the data you've collected from your experiment or
simulation? It's pretty rare that the data gets published without some
kind of analysis being done first. Pandas is a Python package designed
to make this analysis easier, faster and more robust. It harnesses
both Numpy and Matplotlib, so if you're familiar with either of those,
you'll pick it up easily!

We used some materials from Christopher Woods' great "Intermediate
Python and Data Analysis Workshop", which are available from his
website here: <https://chryswoods.com/python_and_data/README.html>
