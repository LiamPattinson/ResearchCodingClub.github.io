It's important to have a broad variety of tools in your belt, and a
new programming language is a great addition. This week, Ed took us
through the basics of Perl 6, a high-level, general purpose
language. Perl has a rich history, its flexibility and expressiveness
making it a favourite of many programmers around the world. Perl 6
represents a complete redesign of the language for the 21st century,
adding a host of new features while maintaining the philosophy of its
sibling language, Perl 5.
