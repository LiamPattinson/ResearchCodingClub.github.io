# Outline

- A very brief history of Python
- Why Python 3?
- The main differences
- Cool features
- Maintaining compatibility

# A very brief history of Python

- Guido van Rossum started work on Python in 1989
    - van Rossum is the *Benevolent Dictator for Life*
- First version released in 1990
- Python 2.0 released in 2000
    - Where Python really came into its own
    - Introduced features like list comprehension and fancy garbage
      collection
- Python 2.6 and 3.0 released in 2008
    - Fixed lots of problems, but in a backwards incompatible fashion
    - Many features were simultaneously backported to 2.6
- Python 3.1 released in 2009
    - Fixed some glaring performance problems in 3.0
- Python 2.7 released in 2010
    - Many features from 3.1 backported to 2.7
    - 2.7 last release in 2.x series
- Python 3.3 released in 2012
    - Official end of Python 2 feature releases
- Python 2.7 end of life in 2020

# The Zen of Python

- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated
- Readability counts
- There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do
  it
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch


# Why Python 3?

## What's wrong with Python 2?

- Various design decisions hindered improvements
- Some features cause of subtle bugs, e.g.
  - Unicode 1: little distinction between text and bytes
  - Unicode 2: `Ãª = 1` *might* work in the interpreter but not in scripts
  - `0777` interpreted as an octal number due to leading `0`
  - `input` automatically `eval`uated what the user typed
- Some names didn't follow convention
- Fixing these things required changing the meaning of existing code
- Python 3 now has a ton more features!

# Major differences

- `byte`s need to be `decode`d into `str` (text)
- `str` are Unicode by default
- No distinction between `int` (machine precision) and `long`
  (arbitrary precision)
- `print` is a function rather than a statement
- Division of two integers returns a `float` by default
- One type of `class` rather than two (!)
- Removed some synonyms for functions: e.g. Python 2 has both `!=` and
  `<>` for "not equals"
- Many functions now return *iterators* rather than `list`s
- Relative imports must be explicit
- New keywords: `with`, `as`, `True`, `False`, `None`
- Better exception handling

# Major differences

- `byte`s need to be `decode`d into `str` (text)
- `str` are Unicode by default
- No distinction between `int` (machine precision) and `long`
  (arbitrary precision)
- **`print` is a function rather than a statement**
- **Division of two integers returns a `float` by default**
- One type of `class` rather than two (!)
- Removed some synonyms for functions: e.g. Python 2 has both `!=` and
  `<>` for "not equals"
- **Many functions now return *iterators* rather than `list`s**
- **Relative imports must be explicit**
- New keywords: `with`, `as`, `True`, `False`, `None`
- **Better exception handling**

# `print` function

## Why?!

- Weird syntax for no newline: `print a,`
- Weird syntax for printing somewhere else: `print >> output, a`
- Difficult to add new syntax: how to change the separator?
- Not very flexible

# `print` function

## Useful things
- Change the separator/newline: `print("a", "b", sep="...", end="")`
- Can be used in new contexts: `map(print, "abc")`
- Can be overridden: (don't do this!)

    ```python
    log = []
    old_print = print
    def print(*args, **kwargs):
        log.append(' '.join(args))
        old_print(*args, **kwargs)
    ```
- or specialised:

    ```python
    my_print = lambda *args, **kwargs: print(*args, **kwargs, sep=":")
    ```

# Digression: expression vs statement

## Expression

- Has a value: `2 / 3`
- Can have a name: `cats = ["Garfield", "Maru", "Ziggy"]`
- Can pass them to functions: `is_square(2 + 2)`
- Limited to: identifiers (`cats`), literals (`2`, `"Ziggy"`) and
  operators (`+`, `()`)

## Statement

- Made of expressions and syntax
- Makes up an executable line: `if cats is not None:`
- Can't be given a name: `assign_f = (f = 1)`
- Can't be passed to functions: `is_square(if)`

# Division

## The first major trip hazard

- In Python 2: `2/3 == 0` and `3/2 == 1`
    - Sometimes surprising, but sometimes what you want
- In Python 3: `2/3 == 0.666...` and `3/2 == 1.5`
    - Less surprising, unless you are a C programmer
- If you want integer division, use `//` instead:
    - `2//3 == 0` and `3//2 == 1` for Python 2 and 3
    - Rounding is down towards negative infinity

# Iterators and views

## The other major trip hazard

- Many functions now return iterators or views
- These are lightweight, memory-efficient objects
- Iterators only get evaluated when you try to use them and become
  empty afterwards
  
  ```python
  >>> cats = {"Garfield": False, "Maru": True, "Ziggy": True}
  >>> real_cats = filter(is_real, cats)
  # <filter at 0x7fc05689bba8> in Python 3
  # [('Maru', True), ('Ziggy', True)] in Python 2
  >>> list(real_cats)   # Convert to a list
  [('Maru', True), ('Ziggy', True)]
  >>> list(real_cats)   # We've already "consumed" the filter
  []
  ```

# Iterators and views

## Views

- Dynamic view into an object
- Reduces memory footprint

    ```python
    >>> cat_names = cats.keys()
    >>> print(cat_names)
    ["Garfield", "Maru", "Ziggy"]
    >>> cats["Pink Panther"] = False
    >>> print(cat_names)
    ["Garfield", "Maru", "Ziggy", "Pink Panther"]
    # ["Garfield", "Maru", "Ziggy"] in Python 2
    ```

# Relative imports

## A problem for packages

- Take a simple package like this:

    ```
    blackholes/
    |- __init__.py
    |- relativity.py
    ```

- ...use one file from another:

    ```python
    # __init__.py
    import relativity
    ```

- And now try to use the package:

    ```python
    import blackholes
    ```

- In Python 2 this works due to the implicit relative import
- But this caused all sorts of headaches, like what if there's another
  `relativity.py` in your `PYTHONPATH`?

# Relative imports

## Python 3 is more explicit

- In Python 3 we get an error:

    ```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/tmp/blackholes/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>
        import relativity
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'relativity'
    ```

- To fix this for Python 3, we need to be explicit about which
  `relativity` we want to import:

    ```python
    # __init__.py
    from . import relativity
    ```
- This will then work properly

# Exceptional exceptions

## Catching multiple exceptions

```python
>>> try:
...   1/0
... except TypeError, ZeroDivisionError:
...     print("Exception suppressed")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
>>> try:
...     1/0
... except (TypeError, ZeroDivisionError):
...     print("Exception suppressed")
...
Exception suppressed
```

# Exceptional exceptions

## Catching multiple exceptions

```python
>>> try:
...     1/0
... except TypeError, ZeroDivisionError:
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    except TypeError, ZeroDivisionError:
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

# Exceptional exceptions

## Exceptions during exceptions (inceptions)

```python
>>> try:
...     1/0
... except Exception:
...     logging.exception("Something went wrong")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
NameError: name 'logging' is not defined
```

# Exceptional exceptions

## Exceptions during exceptions (inceptions)

```python
>>> try:
...     1/0
... except Exception:
...     logging.exception("Something went wrong")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
NameError: name 'logging' is not defined
```

# Features in 3 not in 2

## `f`-strings (3.6)

```python
print("Hello {}".format(name))  # Python 2.7 and 3.5
print(f"Hello {name}")          # Python 3.6
```

## Dictionaries remember insertion order (3.6)

- Used to be an implementation detail
- Now part of the specification
- Also improved memory usage and speed

## Infix matrix multiplication operator (3.5)

```python
S = dot((dot(H, beta) - r).T,
        dot(inv(dot(dot(H, V), H.T)), dot(H, beta) - r))
# becomes
S = (H @ beta - r).T @ inv(H @ V @ H.T) @ (H @ beta - r)
```

# Features in 3 not in 2

## More general unpacking (3.5)

```python
>>> print(*[1], *[2], 3, *[4, 5])
1 2 3 4 5

>>> def fn(a, b, c, d):
...     print(a, b, c, d)
...

>>> fn(**{'a': 1, 'c': 3}, **{'b': 2, 'd': 4})
1 2 3 4
```

# Features in 3 not in 2

## Underscores in numeric literals (3.6)

```python
>>> 1_000_000_000_000_000
1000000000000000
>>> 0x_FF_FF_FF_FF
4294967295
```

## Easier debugging (3.7)

- `breakpoint()` drops you into a debugger

## Type hinting (since 3.0, but useful in 3.5)

- Specify types of function arguments and return values
- Still need an external tool to verify

    ```python
    def greeting(name: str) -> str:
        return 'Hello ' + name
    ```

# Advice

- Write new projects in Python 3.5+!
- Don't bother trying to be backwards compatible
- But if you need to (official advice):
  1. Only worry about supporting Python 2.7
  2. Make sure you have good test coverage (`coverage.py` can help; `pip install coverage`)
  3. Learn the differences between Python 2 & 3
  4. Use `Futurize` (or Modernize) to update your code (e.g. `pip
     install future`)
     
- If you really can't move to 3,

    ```python
    from __future__ import print_function
    from __future__ import division
    ```
