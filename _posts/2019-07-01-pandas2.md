title: More Data Analysis in Python with Pandas

tags: Python Pandas data practical

You've taken some data off an experiment, gathered it in the field, or
dumped it from a bunch of simulations and you've found some amazing
result! How do you quickly show off that result in a beautiful graph?
You could use a spreadsheet, but maybe you want to make it
reproducible and include the code in your paper.

This week we return to Pandas to look at how to plot data and
manipulate graphs with matplotlib.

We used some materials from Christopher Woods' great "Intermediate
Python and Data Analysis Workshop", which are available from his
website here: <https://chryswoods.com/python_and_data/README.html>

You can download the Jupyter Notebook, along with the two data files
we'll be using:

- [notebook](/pandas_files/pandas.ipynb) (as
  [html](/pandas_files/pandas.html))
- [first data file](/pandas_files/city_pop.csv)
- [second data file](/pandas_files/cetml1659on.datpandas_files/cetml1659on.dat)
