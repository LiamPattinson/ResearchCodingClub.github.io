What is Research Software and why is it important? This week, I gave
an overview of best practices you should be following when developing
software for use in your research.

You can get the slides for the talk [here][slides].


# What is Research Software?

- Software used to generate, process or analyse results
- Might be enormous 100k lines of complex simulation code
- Might be 100 lines for pulling data off of instrument
- Might be 10 lines to plot results
- Could even be a spreadsheet!

# Why is Research Software important?

From a 2014 survey:

- 90% of researchers use research software
- 70% said they couldn't do their research without it

##
=> Most modern research is impossible without some form of software!

# Why is **good** Research Software important?

- It's important to be able to trust the results are correct
- If the results are *possibly* wrong, then the research is suspect
- If the research is suspect, it's not science!

# What goes into good research software?

- "Trustable correctness"
- Easy to use
- Easy to maintain
- Portable
- Efficient
- Under version control

## *Sustainability*

"The capacity for software to endure" - Daniel S. Katz

# How to write good software

# Why use tests?

## All software contains bugs!

- Tpyos
- Maths errors
    - Wrong equations used?
- Logic errors
    - Code doesn't do what you think it does
- Edge-case errors
    - Unforeseen sets of circumstances

# Not just a theoretical concern!

Bugs have real world consequences:

- Software on Mars Climate Observer mixed up metric and imperial
  measurements
- Bug in Therac-25 radiation therapy machine delivered "massive
  overdoses of radiation"
- F-22 Raptor aircraft crashed due to software "malfunction"
- Citigroup fined Â£5m for mistaking real data for test data for 15
  years

# Tests are vital

- Tests let you prove that the software is correct
- Tests provide trust that the research is correct
- Tests give you confidence to make changes to the code
- Often faster to write tests first

If it doesn't have tests, it's wrong!

# Testing software

## Types of tests

- **Static analysis**: checking the source code
- **Runtime testing**: checking program is still in a "good state"
- **Unit testing**: checking individual parts of the code are correct
- **System/integrated testing**: checking the program as a whole is
  correct

# Runtime testing

- Most runtime checking can be thought of as either a precondition or
  a postcondition

## Preconditions
- Things that must be true of function inputs:

```python
def square_root(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Can't take square root of negative number")
    ...
```

# Runtime testing

## Postconditions
- Things that must be true of function results:

```python
def square_root(number):
    ...
    if result < 0:
        raise ValueError("Result of square root was negative somehow")

    return result
```

# Runtime testing

## Advantages

- Always there!
- Catch errors and unexpected edge cases early, before they escalate

## Disadvantages

- Have to decide if we can carry on or if should we just give up
- Can slow things down

# Unit testing

- Catch bugs as soon as possible
    - Preferably during development!
- Test individual components
- Test range of inputs
- If the building blocks are correct, the whole thing is more likely
  to be correct
- Good test coverage helps you make changes

# Unit testing

## An example

```python
def test_square_root_4():
    assert square_root(4) == 2

def test_square_root_minus4():
    with raises(ValueError):
        square_root(-4)
```

# Unit testing

## Comparison to known values

- Best to compare to some analytic or exact result
    - Might be a simpler problem
    - Might be a carefully constructed problem
- Can you compare to a "known good" result?
    - From a different implementation?
    - different algorithm?
    - different software?
    - previous version?
- Can be difficult with scientific software, we might not know the
  correct answer!

# Unit testing

## Logic checking

- Does the answer make physical/mathematical sense?
    - Does the molecule have positive mass? Is it travelling slower
      than the speed of light?
    - Does the particle move in the correct direction under these
      forces?
    - Is the inverse of the inverse the identity transform?
- Does the answer make programmatic sense?
    - Is the average of a set of numbers less than the maximum value?
    - Does appending a value increase the size of the container?

# What is version control?

![Is_this_version_control_meme.jpg](/img/simple_version_control.png)

# What is version control?

- Version control systems record changes to a file/set of files over
  time
    - Not just software! This talk is under version control
    - Allows you revert files back to a previous state, compare
      changes over time, see who last modified something, etc.
- Instead of keeping multiple copies of the same file, normally just
  store the *differences* ("diffs") between versions of the files

# Why is version control important?

- Tracking versions
    - Know instantly which is the latest version
    - Roll back to previous versions
    - See history of project/file/line
    - Find out when bugs were introduced
    - Maintain/compare different versions
- Coordination between developers
    - Easier to keep track of when changes are made
    - Easier to work on separate features
    - Easier to merge distinct changes from separate developers
    - Easier to resolve conflicts on same features
    - Tracking who made what changes

If it's not under version control, it doesn't exist!

# Documentation

- Good documentation makes software easier to use and easier to
  maintain
- Documentation is for you in six months!
- Everyone hates writing documentation; everyone hates missing
  documentation
- What counts as documentation?
    - A "README" file
    - An instruction manual
    - A reference manual
    - Code comments
    - Names!
    - Version control commits

# Naming things

- Readability counts!
- Help reduce cognitive load required to understand
- Don't needlessly abbreviate
- Don't just type up maths

## Example

```python
def calcf(r, p):
    ...

def calculate_force(position, momentum):
    ...
```
