This week, Steve led a hands-on demo introducing Jupyter
Notebooks. Notebooks are a great way to keep electronic lab books, for
exploring data, or for sharing analysis methods with your
collaborators. Steve took us through getting Jupyter Notebooks on our
machines, demonstrating their use, and some useful extensions he's
found to make them more useful for recording date stamps for use as a
lab book.

You can read [his guide here][demo].
