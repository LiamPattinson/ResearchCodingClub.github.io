subtitle: Skills and training for people developing research software
---

Coding Club at the University of York is an informal group for people who write or develop
research software in the Department of Physics. We meet every other Wednesday to discuss various
topics around developing software, best practices, and so on, including the odd hands-on session
to learn new skills, or polish rusty ones.

Here are some topics we've covered:

- Version control
- Documentation
- Tests and test driven development
- How modern CPUs work
- Understanding compilers
- Efficient numerical programming with Python

As part of our regular meetings, we also run a drop-in Code Clinic, where you can bring your
coding questions, programming problems and general research software head-scratchers, and our
friendly experts will do their best to help you out!

Subscribe to [our mailing list][1] (you will need to sign into your University of York account) to
get updates on upcoming meetings.

We also have a [Slack channel][2] on the University of York Slack workspace, where you can drop in
any time to get help and advice. This is currently only available to staff and research
postgraduate students.
