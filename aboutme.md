subtitle: Skills and training for people developing research software
---

Physics Coding Club at the University of York is an informal group for people who write or develop
research software in the Department of Physics. We meet weekly to discuss various topics around
developing software, best practices, etc., including the odd hands-on session to learn new skills,
or polish rusty ones.

Here are some topics we've covered:

- Version control
- Documentation
- Tests and test driven development
- How modern CPUs work
- Understanding compilers
- Efficient numerical programming with Python
